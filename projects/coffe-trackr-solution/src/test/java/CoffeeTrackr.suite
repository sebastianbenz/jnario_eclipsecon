#Coffee Trackr

![Coffee](../../src/test/resources/coffee.png)

This is our simple coffee tracking tool made for developers. It works well

##Progress

It is OK if these are red, because all green means we are **done**:

- "Tracking Coffee Consumption"

##Regression

These should always be green as otherwise we have a problem in our implementation:

- \specs.*\
